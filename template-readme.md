## Development

After running a command `npm start`, you can develop it.

## Bundle

Bundle automatically after running command `npm build`.

Every time you run command `npm build`, your `bin` points to production, if you need to switch to development mode, run `npm start`.

## Release CLI

You just need to publish the contents of the `dist` folder.
